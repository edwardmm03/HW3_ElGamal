First, email back this plaintext unencrypted along with all the ElGamal keys used for the encryption.
Second, implement a simple socket-based chat protocol that uses a public-key cryptosystem (RSA or ElGamal)
with a secret-key cryptosystem (DES or AES) in a programming language of your choice. Allow the users to
